## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This app uses Expo with [Expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds). To run the animations, you'll need to install Android and iOS development tools:

#### Android

See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&platform=android

#### iOS

See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&platform=ios

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/omar-bear/kuala-reanimated.git
cd kuala-reanimated

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API configuration:

```env
# API endpoint configuration
API_URL='your api url here'
OPEN_API_URL='your open api url here'
AUTH_BASE_URL='your auth base url here'
BETTER_AUTH_OPEN_API='your better auth api url here'
MODE='development'
```

### Example demo configuration
```env
API_URL='https://start-ui-web-restart.vercel.app/api/rest'
OPEN_API_URL='https://start-ui-web-restart.vercel.app/api/openapi/app/schema'
AUTH_BASE_URL='https://start-ui-web-restart.vercel.app/api/auth'
BETTER_AUTH_OPEN_API='https://start-ui-web-restart.vercel.app/api/openapi/auth/schema'
MODE="DEV"

```

### Development

```bash
# Run the app in development mode
pnpm dev

# Platform-specific development
pnpm android # Launch on Android device/emulator
pnpm ios     # Launch on iOS device/emulator

# Run with Expo Go
pnpm dev
# * Press 's' to switch to Expo Go
# * Scan the QR Code with your phone
```
